I'm building a full-stack ecommerce platform called goZembil (React + TypeScript frontend and Spring Boot backend), integrating Stripe for international payments.

‚ùó Current Critical Issues (Frontend + Stripe)
Stripe Error:

bash
Copy
Edit
Each dictionary in the list "icons" should contain a non-empty UTF8 string field "type"
GET /api/1572/envelope ‚Üí 400 Bad Request
Unrecognized request URL: /api/1572/envelope/
Likely caused by malformed or missing "type" in payment metadata or request body.

Possibly also related to invalid request to a non-existing endpoint.

After payment:

UI still shows /checkout, doesn't redirect to /order-success

No order metadata saved: Order ID: undefined, Payment Method: Unknown

Toast message: Order ID is missing. Please contact support.

Cart is not cleared after successful payment.

Track Your Order button doesn‚Äôt work properly.

Browser Console shows:

POST https://r.stripe.com/b net::ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED (during failure)

Uncaught (in promise) FetchError: Error fetching https://r.stripe.com/...

Stripe logs indicate metadata or identifier is undefined or null

‚úÖ Tasks for AI Agent to Fix
Fix Stripe Metadata + Payment Intent

When creating a PaymentIntent or Session, make sure you're passing:

ts
Copy
Edit
metadata: {
  orderId: generatedOrderId,
  userId: currentUserId,
  paymentType: 'stripe',
  email: currentUser.email,
}
Add valid "type" if using custom dictionaries (icons, line items, etc.)

Remove /api/1572/envelope/ or check why this call is being made‚Äîthis may be due to incorrect error logging or monitoring middleware.

On Successful Payment (Frontend + Backend):

After confirmation from Stripe:

Save orderId and paymentMethod to DB

Return complete order object to frontend

Redirect user from /checkout to /order-success

Show:

‚úÖ Payment success message

üì¶ Track Order (goes to /my-orders/:orderId)

üõçÔ∏è Continue Shopping (goes to /shop)

Clear cart in state and localStorage

Fix Error Handling:

If metadata or order ID is undefined, show:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
We're verifying your order. Please refresh or contact support.
Catch all failed Stripe calls and show user-friendly message.

Backend Fixes:

Ensure createOrder() or completePayment() endpoint:

Generates orderId before Stripe call

Saves payment confirmation data in database

Returns structured response with all required values (orderId, paymentMethod, etc.)

Test Flow:

Simulate test payment using Stripe test card.

Confirm order appears in:

Stripe dashboard

goZembil /my-orders

Admin panel (if applicable)
